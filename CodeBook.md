Overview of Data
-----------------

Used data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
to generate a tidy data set for UCI.

Below is the Original data source of the file.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This contains readings of various activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
of 30 Volunteers (subjects) wearing a smart phone on the waist.Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,3-axial linear acceleration
and 3-axial angular velocity for various measures are captured. Data is split into training(70% volunteer's data) and 
test data (30% volunteer's data)
This (tidied) data set only looks at the average of mean & standard deviation measures only for all the 30 volunteers (test and 
training combined) by activity.

Cleaning and Deriving Data
---------------------------

1) Download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it a local folder.
2) Download the script "run_analysis.R"
3) Source the script "run_analysis.R". (Use Command 1 below)
4) Set "UCI HAR Dataset" (Samsung data directory) as current working directory. Use setwd R command for this.
5) Use "tidydata()" to execute the function
6) Function will generate tidy data file "UCITidyData.txt". If required use command 3 (below) to read the file back into R.


R Commands Reference
-----------------

1) source("run_analysis.R") - Sources the Script to create the function.
2) tidydata() - function which tidies the data as per the project requirements
3) read.table("UCITidyData.txt",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE) - Reads the file "UCITidyData.txt", generated by the script(first command).

Data Dictionary
---------------
Total columns in the file will be 82.
Below is the brief description of each column (in the order they appear in the file).

1) SubjectID		-	Contains values between 1 and 30.ID for each volunteer (subject)
2) ActivityID		-	ID for each of 6 Activities. So it ranges from 1-6.
3) ActivityName		-	Name for each of the activity.Various activities are WALKING(ID:1),WALKING_UPSTAIRS(ID:2),
				WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (ID:3),SITTING(ID:4),STANDING(ID:5),LAYING(ID:6)
4) Column 4 - Column 82	- 	These are averages of mean & Standard deviation of various measures.
